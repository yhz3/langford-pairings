# Langford-Pairings

I created a program in C that can check for Langford Pairings as well as create them using an algorithm.

# How to use

To create a Langford pairing, use ``` -c ``` followed by the size of the Langford Pairing you want generate.

Example:
```
./langford -c 3
3 1 2 1 3 2
```

To check if a sequence is a Langford Pairing, just type in the sequence separated by whitespace.

Example:
```
./langford 3 1 2 1 3 2
It is a langford pairing!
```

## Takeaways

- Learned the importance of printf statements in debugging
- Gained an understanding of pointers and arrays
